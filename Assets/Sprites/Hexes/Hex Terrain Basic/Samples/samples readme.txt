I've included here a few examples of other asset sets I've created:

"Painted 2D Location Hexes: Medieval-Fantasy"    - http://u3d.as/oZ7
"Hex Cold Lands: Painted 2D Terrain"             - http://u3d.as/wkt
"Painted 2D Terrain Hexes: Deserts"              - http://u3d.as/KZb
"Painted 2D Terrain Hexes: Volcanic Wastes"      - http://u3d.as/12Gr
"Hex Tropics & Wetlands: Painted 2D Terrain"     - http://u3d.as/12zZ

Feel free to use any of these sample tiles as-is. If you think they're cool and want more, check out the sets on the Unity Asset Store:
